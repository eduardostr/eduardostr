# Eduardo S. Rodrigues
My name is Eduardo and I'm a student at Uninassau, studying Systems Analysis and Development. 

I'm passionate about using technology to transform everyday tasks, which are often difficult and complicated, into easier and smarter processes. I believe that technology can optimize results and make better use of time, bringing innovation and efficiency to everyday life.
